# Overview

This is the working repository for the ROS Education Workgroup (ROS EdWG) Sandbox development.

The objective of the ROS EdWG Sandbox to create a ROS development and learning environment for undergraduate robotics educators interested in incoroporating ROS in their curriculum.

The Sandbox should be designed so that:

* It is easy to maintain, upgrade, fork, and modify
* Works well with the “Core Platform”
* Is capable of supporting the “semester of robotics”
* Can easily toggle between a simulation and arbitrary real hardware.

More info can be found on [ROS Discourse with the "wg-education" tag](https://discourse.ros.org/search?q=wg-education)

## Short term goal (2023-10-06) 

The short-term goal is to define the [requirements](#requirements) for the sandbox by soliciting information from the broader education community with a survey.

[Here is the draft of survey questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qcCkVwX5YN0T-ueCkMWo1G8AUK8hxPwQBUF0pmiigFU/edit).
